    """This command operates on a keyset.  A keyset is
    defined as a group of keys within a specified time range on one or
    more animation curves.The animation curves comprising a keyset depend on the value
    of the "-animation" flag:Note that the "-animation" flag can be used to override
    the curves uniquely identified by the multi-use
    "-attribute" flag, which takes an argument of the form
    attributeName, such as "translateX".Keys on animation curves are identified by either
    their time values or their indices.  Times and indices can
    be given individually or as part of a list or range (see Examples).The cutKey command cuts curve segment hierarchies from specified
    targets and puts them in the clipboard.  The pasteKey command
    applies these curves to other objects.The shape of the cut curve placed in the clipboard, and
    the effect of the cutKey command on the source animation curve
    depends on the cutKey "-option" specified.  Each of these options
    below will be explained using an example.  For all the explanations,
    let us assume that the source animation curve (from which keys will
    be cut) has 5 keyframes at times 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30.TbaseKeySetCmd.h
    Args:
        animation (str?): Where this command should get the animation to act  
                on.  Valid values are "objects," "keys," and  
                "keysOrObjects" Default: "keysOrObjects."  (See  
                Description for details.)  
                Properties: create
        attribute (Multiuse[str]?): List of attributes to select  
                      In query mode, this flag needs a value.  
                Properties: create, multiuse
        clear (bool?): Just remove the keyframes (i.e. do not overwrite the clipboard)  
                Properties: create
        controlPoints (bool?): This flag explicitly specifies whether or not to include the  
                control points of a shape (see "-s" flag) in the list of attributes.  
                Default: false.  (Not valid for "pasteKey" cmd.)  
                In query mode, this flag needs a value.  
                Properties: create
        float (Multiuse[Range[float]]?): value uniquely representing a non-time-based  
                key (or key range) on a time-based animCurve.  Valid  
                floatRange include single values (-f 10) or a  
                string with a lower and upper bound, separated by a  
                colon (-f "10. 20")  
                      In query mode, this flag needs a value.  
                Properties: create, multiuse
        hierarchy (str?): Hierarchy expansion options.  Valid values are "above,"  
                "below," "both," and "none." (Not valid for "pasteKey" cmd.)  
                In query mode, this flag needs a value.  
                Properties: create
        includeUpperBound (bool?): When the -t/time or -f/float flags represent a range  
                of keys, this flag determines whether the keys at the  
                upper bound of the range are included in the keyset.  
                Default value: true.  This flag is only valid when  
                the argument to the -t/time flag is a time range with  
                a lower and upper bound.  (When used with the "pasteKey"  
                command, this flag refers only to the time range of the  
                target curve that is replaced, when using options such  
                as "replace," "fitReplace," or "scaleReplace."  This  
                flag has no effect on the curve pasted from the clipboard.)  
                Properties: create
        index (Multiuse[int]?): index of a key on an animCurve  
                      In query mode, this flag needs a value.  
                Properties: create, multiuse
        option (str?): Option for how to perform the cutKey operation.  Valid  
                values for this flag are "keys", "curve",  
                "curveCollapse", "curveConnect", "areaCollapse".  The default cut  
                option is: keys  
                Properties: create
        selectKey (bool?): Select the keyframes of curves which have had keys removed  
                Properties: create
        shape (bool?): Consider attributes of shapes below transforms as well,  
                except "controlPoints".  Default: true.  (Not valid for "pasteKey" cmd.)  
                In query mode, this flag needs a value.  
                Properties: create
        time (Multiuse[NullableRange[float]]?): time uniquely representing a key (or key  
                range) on a time-based animCurve. See the code  
                examples below on how to format for a single  
                frame or frame ranges.  
                      In query mode, this flag needs a value.  
                Properties: create, multiuse

    Returns:
        int: Number of animation curves cut.
