# Maya Stubs
Stubs for Autodesk Maya

The goal of this is to get as fully typed stubs for all maya APIs.
This is not a small feat so the stubs will improve over time.

# Usage
You can get the stubs with one of two ways:
1. Download them manually from the [Github releases](https://github.com/Muream/maya-stubs/releases) and let your IDE know of their location.
2. Run `pip install maya-stubs` from the python executable used by your IDE.
